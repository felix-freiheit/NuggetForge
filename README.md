2️⃣ Download NuggetForge to the same folder. 

3️⃣ Open the Terminal on your computer.

4️⃣ In the Terminal, in order to navigate to said folder (in this case Downloads).

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```
5️⃣ Make NuggetForge executable.

```bash
chmod +x NuggetForge_v1_5.sh
```
6️⃣ Run the installer:

```bash
./NuggetForge_v1_5.sh
```

## Optional: Clean system before testing again

If you'd like to reset your Mac to a clean state before re-running NuggetForge, you can use the included `NuggetPurge_v1_0.sh` script.

```bash
chmod +x NuggetPurge_v1_0.sh
./NuggetPurge_v1_0.sh
```
